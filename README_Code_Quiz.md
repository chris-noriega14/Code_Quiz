Homework #4: Code Quiz

GitHub pages URL of the deployed application: https://chris-noriega14.github.io/Code_Quiz/

Webpage Description:

The initial page contains the title of the quiz (Developer Quiz) and a Start Quiz button. The 5 question quiz occurs when you click the Start Quiz button. A timer of 75 seconds gets initialized as well.

The updated page displays the first question of the quiz with 4 different answer choices. The user chooses one of the 4 choices. Depending on the answer choice, a text of Correct! or Wrong! will display on the page and the next question will display. Any incorrect answer subtracts 15 seconds off of the timer. This will be repeated 4 more times if the user responds to all questions within the 75 second time limit, then your final score will be displayed on the webpage. If the timer ends, your final score will be displayed on the webpage.

You will be able to add your initials and final score to the current list of highscores by typing in your initials and pressing Submit.

Once you press Submit, your score should be displayed in a highscore section of the webpage. There is also a button that will clear all of the saved highscores.
