Depending on the answer choice, a text of Correct! or Wrong! will display on the page and the next question will display. This will be repeated 4 more times if the user responds to all questions within the 75 second time limit, then your final score will be displayed on the webpage. If the timer ends, your final score will be displayed on the webpage. The user will obtain 5 points for every correct answer, and 0 points for every incorrect answer.

Once you press Submit, your score should be displayed in a highscore section of the webpage. There is also a button that will clear all of the saved highscores.
